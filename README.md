## Getting Started

* Created a machine learning model for the Fish market dataset - A Database of common fish species for fish market model, You can download the dataset from the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market
* Saved the machine learning model as a pickle file
* Used the pickle file to create a flask app (so that the model can run on the local machine)
* Created a front end webpage by using html and css
* Hosted the model in Heroku which provies a link accessed from anywhere

### Prerequisites
